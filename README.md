# Sports-classifications-
## Neural Network
I aim to build a deep learning model which will classify images according to what sport is being 
played in them. I have 8 different types of sports - Badminton, Basketball, Croquet, Football, Rowing, Swimming, Tennis, and Yoga
We build 2 models:

1. **CNN with the basic architecture** - Conv2D layers, Max Pooling Layers, followed by Dense Layers.

2. **CNN with Transfer Learning** - Weights from a pre-trained model, followed by a Dense Layer for our problem.



##  Dataset Information


The dataset contains 1558  images, which will be split into training and validation sets. 80% of the images will be used to train the model, and the other 20% will be used for validation.
1579 file was found total, 1247  for  training, and 311 for validation
